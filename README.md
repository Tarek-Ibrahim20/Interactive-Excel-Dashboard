# Interactive-Excel-Dashboard
This interactive Excel project delves into the detailed analysis of store data, leveraging pivot tables and interactive visualizations to unearth valuable insights and track key performance indicators (KPIs) like sales and profit. 
##The project unfolds as follows:
### Data Analysis with Pivot Tables and DAX Measures:
The project initiated with a meticulous analysis of store data using pivot tables and DAX measures. This analytical approach enabled the team to address critical questions and monitor essential KPIs vital for business success, such as sales and profit.
### Hyperlink Integration:
A coherent hyperlink structure connects all sheets within the dashboard, enhancing navigation and accessibility for users.
### Interactive Dashboard Creation:
Leveraging the capabilities of MS Excel, an interactive dashboard was meticulously crafted to visualize the insights derived from the data analysis. The dashboard is thoughtfully segmented into three distinct sections, each focusing on specific aspects of store performance and sales dynamics.
### Section 1: Store Overview:
The first section encapsulates crucial information about the store, including total sales, total profit, branch count, order count, product count, quantities sold per product, and more. This section serves as a comprehensive snapshot of the store's performance metrics.
